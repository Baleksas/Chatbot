## Chatbot

I built this project to gain a better understanding of Next.js 13 features and to explore the possibilities of integrating OpenAI API and compare its various models' capabilities

## Tech

- Next.js 13
- React 18
- Three.js
- Typescript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can view deployed project with [this link](https://youvsai-baleksas.vercel.app/) with your browser to see the deployed version of the project.

## Running yourself

If you want to run the project with your own api key using your own OpenAI resources, you can do that by following instructions:

1. ` git clone https://github.com/Baleksas/Chatbot.git`

2. Create .env file in the root of this project and using .env.example file, paste in your API key which you can acquire here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

3. Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` - application will now be available without restrictions for using chatbot. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
